# Pascal GILLET - DevOps/Data Engineering/Software Development

![Aiguille Dibona - Massif des Écrins](img/ecrins-pointe-dibona.JPG)
 
Hello, world! I am a software engineer specialized in Big Data with a growing interest in AI/ML/DL (and yes, it was a 
very good catchphrase in 2014).

In my everyday work, I am involved in cloud computing and data management in general: issues related to the capture, 
storage, retrieval, sharing, analysis and visualization of (big) data. 

I define myself as a technical person and I love getting my hands into the code.

This resume is primarily for myself to keep track of the really boring details of my professional life.

*   Implemented sample applications as a good starting point for Alcatel's applications
*   Implemented a reusable BSCS login module (JAAS) for the authentication and authorization of users
*   Implemented a library achieving logging separation, i.e. distinct configuration of multiple web applications while 
sharing the logging binaries in the Servlet container (or any JEE environment)

airline organization. It includes software validation, software receiving and distribution.

- Storage of large amount of software
- Integration with various external applications (SAP)
- Multi aircraft programs: A380, A400M, etc.
- Full-time availability

Other boring details:

**Release 4**: proposal and implementation of an architecture overhaul due to a performance degradation caused by an 
increasing activity and a monolithic architecture implemented on earlier prototype based solutions (poor mechanisms for 
file locking, then worked poorly with multiple users):

- Business logic components: EJB allowing concurrency control & transaction processing
- Application servers: JBoss (development), WebSphere (integration & production environments)
- Persistence layer: Hibernate
- RDBMS: Oracle
- Storage of raw data representing software in BLOBs
- Messaging service (JMS) for asynchronous data transfer (data mirroring) and operation notification

Proposal and implementation of the **FLS library** covering the [ARINC](https://www.arinc.com/cf/store/catalog_detail.cfm?item_id=78) 
specification. The library aims to read, write and validate Field Loadable Softwares by ensuring data integrity and 
authenticity. It has been primarily used within the architecture quoted above but can be reused for other applications 
within the airline organization as this file format is very widespread at it.

  interface) to build a coherent and stable corpus
  - Java multi-layer perceptron (delta rule, gradient descent) to demonstrate that artificial neural networks alone are 
  relevant for the given goal
